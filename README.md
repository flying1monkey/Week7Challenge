# Week7Challenge
Robo Resume v5

Assignment:

ConnectUp Assignment - 

   
Continue developing your own version of LinkedIn (the resume app) providing web access to users' resumes.
What's New?

Users can sign up with one of two roles - job seekers and recruiters.

Recruiters now post jobs - jobs have skill requirements as part of the posting
Users can search for jobs in addition to people, companies (employers) and schools
Users receive notifications when jobs that match their skills are posted

The requirements from the last challenge must still be met. You do not need COURSES any longer - this was practice for the MANY TO MANY relationship.

NOTE ALSO that notifications are not supposed to be complicated - they are just messages that show to users.

 A job should contain:

=============================================================

    A title,
    an employer,
    a salary range,
    a description and
    a list of skills.


NOTE: Notifications not done
